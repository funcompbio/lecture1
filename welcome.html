# Computational biology

* [Computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) is the study
  of biology using computation.

* Computational biology **is** biology, because the word _computational_ is an adjective.

* Fundamentals of Computational Biology (FCB) will introduce to you concepts and basic tools
  of computation and information technologies, required to address biological questions using a computer.

* The purpose of introducing this subject at the beginning of the curriculum is to enable the student using the tools and abilities acquired in FCB throughout the whole degree.

---

# Course topics

* The main topics of FCB are:

  * Manipulating files from the command line.
  * Programming.
  * Development of automatized and reproducible workflows, in the context of
    biological data analysis.

* These skills are highly and increasingly appreciated in academic and industrial environments
  from the life sciences.

* Your CV can grow with every technique, tool or platform that you will learn to use in FCB.

---

# Course structure

* Three types of sessions:
  * Presential (pres): first, second and last lecture, second practical, all seminars.
  * Online-synchronous (sync): third lecture, all practicals except the second one.
  * Online-asynchronous (asyn): lectures, except for first to third and last.

* Presential sessions may go online-synchronous in case of covid19 restrictions.

# Course workload

* One single group-class for lectures (~ 60 students/group), two for seminars (~ 30 students/group),
  four for practicals (~ 15 students/group)

* One ECTS (~ 25hrs) throughout 10 weeks:
  * 3 hrs of lectures
  * 2 hrs of seminars
  * 2 hrs of practicals
  * 16 hrs of unsupervised work (study, assignments, etc.)

* FCB has 5 ECTS, 125hrs in 10 weeks (~ 12 hr/week). Because of the learning goals of FCB, we
  reduce 4 hrs of lectures to have one more seminar:
  * **11** lectures = 11 hrs
  * **6** seminars x 2 hrs = 12 hrs
  * **10** practicals x 2 hrs = 20 hrs
  * 43 hrs of class time work (~ 4 hrs/week)
  * 82 hrs of out-of-class time work (~ 8 hrs/week)

---

# Course evaluation

* Continuous (60%) + final (40%) over a total of 10 points.

* Continuous evaluation:
  * Seminars through a test on programming problem solving (1 point on the final grade): **November 9th, 11:30-12:30**
  * Practicals through the submission of computer assignments (2 points on the final grade): ~ 8 assignments, one week submission period, penalty for late submissions.
  * Programming project (3 points on the final grade): ~ 14hrs work including 2 seminars, submission deadline ~Dec 10th, penalty for late submissions.

---

# Course evaluation

* Final evaluation:
  * Multiple-choice exam ("PEM" in its Catalan acronym) for 50% of the final evaluation.
  * Open written test ("Assaig" in its Catalan acronym) for 50% of the final evaluation.

* To pass FCB at the end of the term, the student must:
  1. Obtain a minimum grade of 4/10 in the average evaluation of seminars and practicals.
  2. Obtain a minimum grade of 4/10 in the evaluation of the programming project.
  3. Obtain a minimum grade of 4/10 in the final evaluation.

* Remedial exam on July for the final (40%) evaluation. **It is not possible** to retake
  the continuous evaluation.

# Software tooling

* You need to install in your computer the following software tools:
  * Unix shell: by Practical 1 on October 2nd.
  * Git version-control system: by Practical 1 and October 2nd.
  * Text editor: by Practical 2 and October 5th.
  * Python and Jupyter Notebook: by Practical 4 and October 15th.
  * R and RStudio Notebook: by Practical 8 and November 12th.

* You will find full instructions at https://funcompbio.github.io/setup

---

# Social-media productivity profiles

* We will be using two social-media productivity platforms:
[GitHub](https://github.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com).

* You will need to create a profile in each of these platforms
(instructions will follow) using your UPF student email
address.

* It is **very important** that you check and use your UPF
student email address for any communication related to FCB.

* Important announcements, deadlines, etc. related to FCB
will only occur through your UPF student email address and
the FCB Moodle site.

* GitHub and Slack are tools to facilitate the achievement
of the learning goals of FCB, but do not replace the UPF
student email and FCB Moodle site for official communications.

# Social-media productivity profiles - GitHub

* **GitHub** is a provider of hosting for software
development and version control using Git.

* The UPF has recently become a partner school of its
[education program](https://education.github.com),
which will allow us to use [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com)
for submitting and correcting assignments from practicals.

* Actually, **all assignments will be privately stored** under the
github profile [https://github.com/funcompbio](https://github.com/funcompbio)
and **your public GitHub profile can stay completely empty**.

* Your GitHub account can become a productive and powerful platform for
your computational work throughout the degree: **keep it alive
throughout the degree**.

* You may consider using it to store some of your student
assignments/projects, make them even public and make even
your own professional profile; see, for instance
[https://lucywan.github.io](https://lucywan.github.io)
or
[https://dieuwkehupkes.github.io](https://dieuwkehupkes.github.io).

# Social-media productivity profiles - Slack

* **Slack** is a messaging platform that allows one to organize messages
by topic, is all searchable, facilitates sending code and attachments and
integrates with other platforms, including [Google G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/slack)
and [GitHub](https://slack.github.com).

* The UPF offers a Slack workspace called _upfbarcelona_ for all members of the UPF community
(students, faculty, etc.); see [https://guiesbibtic.upf.edu/slack](https://guiesbibtic.upf.edu/slack).

* We have a Slack workspace for FCB called _fcb2020upf_ associated with the
URL: [https://fcb2020upf.slack.com](https://fcb2020upf.slack.com), but
**it has no public profiles**.

# Moodle site

* The Moodle site of FCB will be the entry point for all materials and activities.

<img src="moodlesitewindow.png" width="60%">

---

# GitHub site

* The GitHub site of FCB at [https://funcompbio.github.io](https://funcompbio.github.io)
will store the materials (lectures, seminars and practicals), which will be linked from
the Moodle site.
